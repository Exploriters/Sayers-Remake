  <Sayers_Start.description>Everything is as usual, there is no alarm in case of emergency, no growl of canines when they're provoked, no time passes between white, gray and colorless, just open your eyes again after a rest. As always, you are held in your hands by creatures many times bigger than you and taken to dangerous or complicated rooms.
This is your day, in countless different rooms, learning new things with your partner and mastering your body in a very short time. You learned to run and jump a few days after you was born, and now you're familiar with spelling at the age of a few months. This is you, you, growing up at an abnormal speed.
Only this time, your destination is not red, not white, but a metal cabin. You and the other two Sayers were put inside, trying to wait for instructions, but the door was closed. You brushed the hatch with your tentacle in doubt, but you already know that everything is not up to you.

When the hatch is opened again, you will see a completely strange world. The lonely seeds buried in your heart from the beginning of your birth erupt at this moment, growing wildly and wantonly, filling your chest. This grief eventually turns into a trembling airflow, which makes you scream at the sky, but in the end it just throws your voice into nothingness.
It's time to calm down, the program in your brain says. After rapid cooling, the grief of wanton growth was cut off by indifference and ruthlessness. At this moment, all you can think about is the long way home.
