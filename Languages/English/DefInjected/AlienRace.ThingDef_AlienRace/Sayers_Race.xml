Sayers is obviously not a neaturally evolved species. They're full of experimental traces. Not only are they highly unstable in genes, but the implantation of their plant parts is also somewhat rought, which directly leads to their partial vision loss and temperature sensitivity. They need to take care of their own plant parts more carefully to avoid their own organ failure caused by apoptosis. They were rudely deprived of their forelimbs and replaced by plant tentacles, which may have forced them to learn how to walk only with their hindlimbs and to face some of the tasks that became more difficult after losing their forelimbs.
	

Even with a high degree of wisdom, regardless of age, Sayers still seems like a cub. After being lost, they're confused about there they belongs and where they can call "home". This highly collective little creature often embarks on an impossible way home after being abandoned.</Alien_Sayers.description>
