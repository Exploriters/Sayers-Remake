  <!-- ZH: 作为最早被抛弃于边缘世界的赛尔斯之一，常春藤将自己所遭遇的无依苦难加于它所叙述的故事之中。常春藤将会让殖民者受到更频繁的袭击、威胁，却又将可以作为友伴的人们远远推开，逼迫着殖民者同它一样，去独自面对这几乎不讲道理的世界。但，它也将让殖民者变得更为坚强。\n\n这个故事叙述者还并没有被配置完成！ -->
  <storyTeller_Ivy.description>As one of the earliest Sayers abandoned in the rim world, Ivy added its helpless sufferings to the stories it told. Ivy will make the colonists suffer more frequent attacks and threats, but it will push away people who can be friends, forcing the colonists to face this almost unreasonable world alone, just like it. However, it will also make the colonists stronger.
